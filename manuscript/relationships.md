# Relationships

The defining characteristic of improv at the Magnet seems to be its focus on relationships as the driver for game. I think focusing on relationships is the better move when teaching improvisors. People tend to get really in their head about game causing their moves to be less present and less earned.

I liken Magnet vs UCB to the difference between campers rubbing sticks together to create fire vs chemists studying the nature of fire. Knowing the ins and outs of the chemical reaction behind fire won't necessarily help you survive in the wild.

## H vs A characters

At Camp Magnet 2019, Bianca Casusol mentioned that ideally characters should be vertical and independent, with a relationship line between them (like the letter H) rather than co-dependent (like the letter A). A character should be able to exist on their own if their scene partner ever leaves.
