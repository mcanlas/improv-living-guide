# Style

## TJ and Dave

On June 9, 2019, I went to my first ever (and only so far) TJ and Dave show. Their style is far more comedic than I was lead to believe. Maybe I have an unreasonable link that slow means not funny.

Random notes about their style (in this one show) that I noticed.

- I think they organically arrived at the phrase "get off my dick". Interesting how they honored its second beat by having an entire debate between auxiliary characters about the validity of the phrase, never really saying it outright. And then the button on the scene in an unexpected, unearned way was simply repeating in full "get off my dick". Really solid use of tension and release.
- I think one of the scenelets had an organic initiation of "I hate it when you put it in bay one, put it back in bay two". I don't think it was ever really established what those were. But they seemed very comfortable to be hitting that dynamic repeatedly and utilizing it in a grounded way with basic object work, despite never really clarifying what they bays are or what they are for (no place, no occupation other than "workers").
- Multiple times, in character, they would ask "what's that?" as in, "please repeat that, I didn't hear what you said", which I think is extremely interesting. It means they put a premium on making sure they hear what each other is saying and are fine melding that into their character work.
- Ironically, they talk over each other often. Personally, I hate this. Maybe it's okay because they've known each other for such a long time and in such an intimate format. Maybe they can multi-task (unlikely) listening and speaking. Maybe they are keeping an earshot out for non-verbal contributions like tonality. Maybe they only do this when the words are unimportant and just performative. But that last one is unlikely given the frequency in which they talked over one another. My greatest fear is that newer improvisors will look at this and say "TJ and Dave don't wait to talk, why should I?" which is a terrible takeaway.
- Every move they made seemed to be in service of a game or a laugh. Everything felt very self-less. There didn't seem to be much ego. Even very distinct looking/sounding solo characters stayed pretty grounded and were framed in servicing some punchline or through line.
- Very light light amount of body switching.
