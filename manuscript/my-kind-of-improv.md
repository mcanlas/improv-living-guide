# My Kind of Improv

A Magnet teacher once lamented, someone saying "I'm not into improv" is like saying "I'm not into television". It's weird to write off an entire medium. But I guess the problem stems from lack of exposure to different kinds of improv. Here are some aspects that really resonate with me.

## Organic delivery

Compare the following lines.

> A: You're a doctor. I need help.
>
> B: Doc, gimme the news.

The first is something a novice improvisor might say. It's effective in establishing a reality and a relationship. But it just sounds stilted. It's improv-speak.

The second is much more natural-sounding. But the trap here is that it requires much more interpretation on the listener's end. If you don't have a sharp partner who is picking up what you're laying down, lines like this might get you in trouble. As an audience member, I always much prefer the most organic delivery possible.

## Fast listening

Here's an initiation.

> Shannon!? Shannon Bernacky? It's Alice, from John Jay High!

Here are two responses.

> A: Hi. We went to high school together.
>
> B: Class of 2004! AHHH!!!!

The first response is a very straight "yes and" but it's more of just a "yes". The two players have firmly established their relationship to the audience and one another. However, it's boring and lacks a lot of "and".

The second response adds more information and confirms the relationship via emotion rather than via words. I prefer watching moves like this, but they can be more difficult to play if the people on stage aren't in sync. A way to tank a sexy response like this is for the first player to say the following because they were not sure if their partner understood.

> Shannon, we went to high school together.

Now we've established to everyone that we are not on the same page and need to invest in safety lines like this.

## Degree of difficulty

If improv were judged like an Olympic sport, "degree of difficulty" would be one of the things we measure. I think really great, entertaining improv has some element of magic or difficulty to it. It's usually the parts of the show that makes those not in the know exclaim, "that was planned, right?".

Including but not limited to duets with harmony, universal choruses, strong tableaus, and nicely wrapped endings.

## Musical improv

In general, a musical improv team commits harder and faster than a normal team. Straight improv rarely hits high highs where as musical improv is very effective very often.

A good musical improv team is necessarily maintaining a high level of synchronicity and tackling things that are harder than normal improv \(lyric writing, melody writing, choreography, etc\).

The "highlights" thread for musical improv is always much more boisterous and elaborate than the highlights thread for other nights.
