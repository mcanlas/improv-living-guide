# Improv

## Unprepared

One thing that struck me odd about intro to improv classes is that you get up to perform straightaway.  There's never any handholding about projecting your voice, where to look, how to stand.

## Theater

It still feels weird to meet to look at improv as a part of the overall theater scene. It often feels like it's own bubble. But there are tons of actors who do improv to enhance their careers.

I've thought of taking an acting 101 class to see how it would affect my improv.

A UCB teacher once remarked about playing realistically in improv, "The worst you can do is a piece of theater." Realism helps ground the crazy and give it its inherent funniness. If everything is crazy, the audience can't follow along or won't buy into the reality.
