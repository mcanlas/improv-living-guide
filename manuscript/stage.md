# Stage

## Setting chairs

Bianca: Don't frantically place chairs. Calmly put the chairs where you want them, or else the frantic energy will bleed into the scene.

## Clearing the stage

After getting the get, I strongly recommend clearing the stage. This gives you the opportunity to more clearly initiate from a blank slate rather than inherit the energy and posture of the get (generally the group standing upright in an arc).

I've never asked him about it personally, but I've seen Will Jacobs take a circular sweep in his general area after getting the get. I'm calling this move The Will Jacobs.
