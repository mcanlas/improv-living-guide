# Musical Improv

## Fear

On my first day of musical improv class, the teacher asked us why we signed up. The number one response, maybe 80% of the people, was "fear". A lot of people wanted to confront their fear in style!

## Musical background

I came into musical improv with a musical background. I've sung in lots of choirs but never did musical theater. I thought I was hot shit.

To anyone wondering "do I need to be a singer to do musical improv?" the answer is no. The class definitely has musical elements. The experience will be enhanced if you are musically inclined, but in no way is it a requirement.

People underestimate how much musicality is built into their bodies and minds \(pop music, leading tones, etc\). A lot of musical improv revolves around using people's natural instincts, no special training required.

And to anyone that insists, "what if I'm tone-deaf?" I've only met one tone deaf person in my entire life. That phrase is over-used. People by and large are not tone-deaf.

People may need to work on listening for and staying on rhythm.

Also, there are so many facets to musical improv. Musicality is just one of them. Some of the best musical improvisors I've seen I would not describe as the strongest musically, so it doesn't matter.

## Juggling

I liken musical improv to juggling five balls when you can only handle three. When you first do it, it can be stressful trying to balance dancing, singing, listening, support work, and what not all at the same time. It feels very overwhelming. Eventually you learn to mentally compartmentalize and it does get easier with time and practice.

One time I did an entire group number and completely forgot to sing.

* Melody writing
* Lyric writing
* Choreography \(leading, following\)
* Harmonizing
* Support work, listening

## Improv

For a while I was loathe to admit that musical improv is still very much rooted in improv. When the accompaniment isn't playing, you should still have good scene work.

Any amount of straight improv experience is great to have going into a musical improv class. It's not required, but it will greatly enhance your experience \(since you won't be learning how to make stuff up AND learning how to sing\).

## Regular vs musical

Musical. There's something very magical and fun about being able to burst into song.

There's also a level of dynamism and commitment and teamwork that I would see more often in a musical show than in a regular show. My dream is to either watch or play straight scenes with that level of engagement.
