# Exercises

## Pointies

Everyone stands in a circle. The starting person points to someone and says a word. The next person points to another person and says another word. Repeat until a pattern is established with where the words are coming from and that everyone has a word and a person to point to \(should repeat in a circle\).

Reset and repeat with another set of words and different targets.

Try to sustain two sets of words simultaneously. Up to three.

## Class callbacks

During a recent UCB class, we used the last 10 minutes of class to do callback scenes inspired by anything that happened during that class. I think this is a great way to introduce the idea of callbacks and to have students exercise their memory muscle by having the callback window span the entire class.

## Mapping realism

Play out each row, first as a straight scene \(no comedy\), then again with the same level of gravity but discussing something else.

| Straight | Twist |
| :--- | :--- |
| Ex-lovers running into one another at the supermarket | Strangers who just met minutes ago in the parking lot, running into one another at the supermarket |
| A couple discussing a breakup | Two people discussing a change in laundromat |
| A confrontation over cheating in a relationship | A confrontation over cheating in a diet |
| Two people meeting as college roommates | Two people meeting as jail cell mates |
| Marriage proposal | Asking to finish one's burrito |
| Coming back from war | Coming back from the DMV |
| Confessing about a drunk kiss | Confessing about drunkenly purchasing a yacht |
| Standing over a father's open casket | Standing over a party sub that has been eaten |


# My exercises

## Repeat repeat

Two person scene (whatever) but each actor repeats their line.

Goals:
- stick to the exact wording you use
- use emphatic/non-verbal delivery
- cast out short, repeatable gifts (prevent rambling)
