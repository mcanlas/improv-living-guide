# Manuscript directory

There are three ways to view the contents of this directory.

## On GitHub

GitHub is able to render markdown files with its viewer.

## On Leanpub

The [Leanpub manifest file](Book.txt) is an ordered whitelist of files in this directory. Each file becomes a chapter in the book generated by Leanpub. The whitelist ignores this README file (intended only for GitHub) and the `index.md` file (intended only for `sbt-microsite`)

## On the microsite, hosted on GitHub Pages

The plug-in `sbt-microsites` is able to generate a microsite based on Markdown files in this directory. This microsite is then hosted on GitHub's site for hosting user content.
