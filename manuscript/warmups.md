# Warm-ups

## Crazy 8s

To a count of eight, shake your right arm raised. Then your left arm, right leg, left leg. Then each down to a count of one. Then "woo!!". But some people end it with "awww crazy 8s!".

## Bird/egg (Kanellis)

A physicality warm-up. Teacher says bird, you stand up, puff our your chest, and beat your wings, cawww.

Teacher says egg, you scrunch down like you're trying to hatch. Alternate.

## Alpha bravo

Circle up, with a bit of space between. Someone initiate a repetitive sound and motion. Everyone else match that sound and motion as much as possible. After a groove has been established, someone else interrupt with a new sound and motion (at a different rhythm). Everyone else match that new sound and motion. Repeat after a groove has been established, etc.

## Genre cauldron

An idea-generating exercise useful for priming the group to think about genre-specific tropes. Typically used in musical formats. Coach shouts out a genre (e.g. country westerns, R&B songs) and everyone organically contributes things to the circle that they are thinking of in relation to the genre. Go in any order until the genre is tapped out or generation slows down.

## 1, 2, 3, nailed it!

One person is "it". Group counts, 1, 2, 3, with the it person making organic poses each count. Every else has matching energy. It person starts scenelette but everyone organicly participates with matching energy. When scenelette is over, everyone goes hands in and up and says "nailed it!"

## Scenework

- no suggestion: vague initiation to clarification
- suggestion to banal initiation: clarify/contextualize with relationship (intense like mother/Batman)
- suggestion to banal initiation: clarify/contextualize with location
- pocket an emotion given coach: banal initiation to emotional response
