# Warm-ups

## Crazy 8s

To a count of eight, shake your right arm raised. Then your left arm, right leg, left leg. Then each down to a count of one. Then "woo!!". But some people end it with "awww crazy 8s!".

## Bird/egg (Kanellis)

A physicality warm-up. Teacher says bird, you stand up, puff our your chest, and beat your wings, cawww.

Teacher says egg, you scrunch down like you're trying to hatch. Alternate.

## Alpha bravo

Circle up, with a bit of space between. Someone initiate a repetitive sound and motion. Everyone else match that sound and motion as much as possible. After a groove has been established, someone else interrupt with a new sound and motion (at a different rhythm). Everyone else match that new sound and motion. Repeat after a groove has been established, etc.

## Genre cauldron

An idea-generating exercise useful for priming the group to think about genre-specific tropes. Typically used in musical formats. Coach shouts out a genre (e.g. country westerns, R&B songs) and everyone organically contributes things to the circle that they are thinking of in relation to the genre. Go in any order until the genre is tapped out or generation slows down.

## 1, 2, 3, nailed it!

One person is "it". Group counts, 1, 2, 3, with the it person making organic poses each count. Every else has matching energy. It person starts scenelette but everyone organicly participates with matching energy. When scenelette is over, everyone goes hands in and up and says "nailed it!"

## Scenework

- no suggestion: vague initiation to clarification
- suggestion to banal initiation: clarify/contextualize with relationship (intense like mother/Batman)
- suggestion to banal initiation: clarify/contextualize with location
- pocket an emotion given coach: banal initiation to emotional response

## One word stories

Circle up. One word at a time, like fairy tale. Person can say PERIOD to end thought.

Variant: SECRETS. Instead of "period", say "secrets" like oooOOooo.

## What a great wedding!

Circle up. Primary person says they have a themed wedding. Everyone says "what a great wedding!" Each person pitches something apropos to that wedding. Then next primary person, etc.

## Knife throw

- encircle
- someone mime throwing a knife to someone
- recipient mimes catching the knife between their hands (e.g. with a clap)
- recipient becomes the thrower; repeat
- level 2: you catch for the person on your left. e.g. if they are attacked, you must catch their knife. and you are the thrower.

## Zombies

- encircle, with one person in the middle as the "slow zombie"
- initially, pick any target to walk slowly towards, to tag
- victim needs to make eye contact with someone in the circle
- that someone needs to shout out a name of someone else
- zombie must slow walk to the target that is shouted out
- person becomes zombie if a) tagged by zombie b) not following rules (e.g. target shouts improperly)
- levels: requirement for commnicating name becoming more complex (e.g. whisper to someone else for them to shout)

## Group reaction

- encircle, one person in the middle
- person in the middle makes neutral, un-loaded statement
- circle reacts cohesively to it (like all like or all hate, etc)
- middle person continues with another statement (slightly narrative?)
- circle heightens their group reaction.
- repeat until climax (4 ish reactions?)
