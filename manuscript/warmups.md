# Warm-ups

## Alpha bravo

Circle up, with a bit of space between. Someone initiate a repetitive sound and motion. Everyone else match that sound and motion as much as possible. After a groove has been established, someone else interrupt with a new sound and motion (at a different rhythm). Everyone else match that new sound and motion. Repeat after a groove has been established, etc.
