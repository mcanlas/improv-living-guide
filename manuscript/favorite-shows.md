# Favorite Shows

Here are some my favorite shows in the city. Spoiler alert, they're all at the Magnet Theater!

## Musical Megawatt

Every Tuesday night, Magnet's eight musical house teams perform \(two teams per hour block\). The great number of house teams is a great testament to Magnet's commitment to being the leader in musical improv.

I used to overdose on this show and watch everything. Sometimes you can't help yourself because the improv is that good.

Each team also has their own style. You won't be watching eight musical Harolds.

## Friday Night Show

Before each show, the theater collects written, anonymous confessions into a bucket. Then to inspire scenes, improvisors take slips from the bucket and read them aloud. As the night progresses, callbacks and remixes happen more frequently.

I really love the speed of this show. And it's filled to the brim with some of Magnet's best and fastest players.

Sometimes I wonder if they're really reading the slips or making things up. Sometimes they read full sentences! Small handwriting from the audience?

## Premiere

Instructors and senior musical improvisors take the stage for one full hour. It's like a powered up version of Musical Megawatt.

Megawatt performances can sometimes feel rushed at 25 minutes. Premiere on the other hand has the luxury of time, so they can explore characters and the environment more fully and even engage in more games that don't move the plot forward.

If you've never seen musical improv \(or want to show it to someone else who hasn't\) and you can only see one show, this is the one.

## Trike

Fast two-person improv. The way they handle digressions and edits has been likened to cutaways in Family Guy.

It's impressive to see two performers hold up an entire universe of characters and navigate through them with breakneck speed.
