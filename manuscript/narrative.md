# Narrative

## Plot

Plot is not as important as the emotional dynamic or emotional river. Plot is just a tiny boat which you can be in, but is not as big as the river is wide and constant.

## Implied plot

Sometimes plot can happen between scenes so that the scenework can focus on characters and relationships rather than plot details.

## Time dashes

Scene don't need to be done in real time.

## Training montage

Sometimes it is nice to see a semi real-time view of character growth in the form of a musical training montage (one task/challenge per verse).
