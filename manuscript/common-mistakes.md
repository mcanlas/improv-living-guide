# Common Mistakes

Here's a collection of behaviors one is likely to see with newer improvisors. If they happen with more experienced improvisors, I think it's a crime they weren't coached out of these behaviors.

Some people say there's no "right" or "wrong" way to improv. I don't think this is true. Improv isn't a random collection of responses. There are some moves that are stronger or weaker or more helpful than others. So maybe there isn't a 100% wrong or 100% right, but there is some form of value judgement and ordering of potential moves.

## Not caring hard enough

Improv, in reality, is incredibly low stakes. There are no props, no costumes, no script, and no budget. Therefore, it is important to contour what you do have (imaginary props and imaginary scripts) with importance. Treat things importantly.

Often times, newer improvisors will drop bombs like "I'm being taken away in a spaceship" or "my dog just died" but the subsequent reactions won't match. If any of those things were said in real life, the reactions would be way more different and intense.

If a bomb is used, it's important to honor that bomb.

Even if it isn't a bomb (e.g. "check out my blue shirt"), it is important by virtue of being in the scene. Otherwise we're losing out on opportunities for discovery or at worst we aren't listening to what our scene partner is really saying (i.e. if the statement was an oblique suggestion to start a game).

Exercise from Bianca: Do a spit take (i.e. extreme reaction) in response to some mundane response.

## Status fighting

Many scenes can be boiled down into a status dynamic of high and low. The lack of clarity in a scene can be caused by the improvisors not knowing or not agreeing who the high and low status characters are.

A symptom of this is when one character pitches an idea to the other, but the idea is met with skepticism rather than with acceptance. (Of course, the acceptance can be in the form of a rejection from the perspective of the character, in addition to a straightforward acceptance).

## Debating

This might be the same as above.

## Playing indifferent

Organic contributions like "check out my blue shirt" might be ignored completely. Or even intentional bombs could be ignored.

Or maybe the responding improvisor is choosing to play a character who is indifferent. This is very hard to play.

Characters should always care. Back to providing contour.

## Playing externally

Lots of improvisors like to talk about people who aren't there (e.g. "my boyfriend Steve"). A scene is more active if the relationship being discussed is right there, between the two characters on stage.

The one exception to this rule is if the offstage character is of inordinately great importance and affects the onstage characters in a significant way. This is more appropriate for narrative forms where the offstage character has a higher likelihood of being portrayed.

Also the constant talk of external factors sets up an expectation to the audience that this will be realized in some way (i.e. seeing said boyfriend in the next scene).

## Pitching ideas

Boring scene content.

## Talking about future plans

Similar to above. Replace in favor of active scenework (do the thing you are talking about and deal with the aftermath).

## Being surprised

There are times when it is okay to be surprised in a scene, but the difference is subtle. Most times, being surprised is the actor being hesitant of the idea. By default, all behaviors and gifts should be mundane and habitual. If it is revealed that a character loves sky diving, that is only a reveal to the audience, not to the characters on stage. Surprise as characters should only come after a foundation has been developed.
