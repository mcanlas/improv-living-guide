# Forms

## Expansion Harold

Harold. But the second beats can happen in any order. (Is this a property of any Harold?)

## The Montage

As taught at Magnet's Level 5 Conservatory. Not to be confused with a musical montage.

- Eight players
- Four first beat two-person scenes
- Each with an early/first line absurdity
- Second beat heightens with the same characters, walk-ons allowed
- Third beats are freestyle

## The Expansion

As taught at Magnet's Level 5 Conservatory. Not to be confused with the expansion harold.

- Eight players
- Three first beat scenes
- Played for maximal realism (the complete lack of absurd or melodramatic elements)
  - How would you really react in real life?
- Second beat follows one character with the most heat/drama beside a new character with high social value
- Third beats are freestyle
