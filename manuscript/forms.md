# Forms

## The Harold

Jeremy Bent: Think of the Harold as a pyramid. Spend the most time in first beats (width?) and the least time in third beats (over 20s too slow)

## Expansion Harold

Harold. But the second beats can happen in any order. (Is this a property of any Harold?)

## The Montage

As taught at Magnet's Level 5 Conservatory. Not to be confused with a musical montage.

- Eight players
- Four first beat two-person scenes
- Each with an early/first line absurdity
- Second beat heightens with the same characters, walk-ons allowed
- Third beats are freestyle

## The Expansion

As taught at Magnet's Level 5 Conservatory. Not to be confused with the expansion harold.

- Eight players
- Three first beat scenes
- Played for maximal realism (the complete lack of absurd or melodramatic elements)
  - How would you really react in real life?
- Second beat follows one character with the most heat/drama beside a new character with high social value
- Third beats are freestyle

## Pinata

- Level 6
- long, opening scene
- second beats
- third beats
- think of entrances as new scenes, new energy. Let energy of the scene be affected and change. everyone shift focus to new character
- more "distant" than normal scenes. okay to talk about foreign problems.
- pretend as if prompt was "so what's up with you". what is your idle character bitching about?
- suggestion is location that can fit on the stage
  - could be a more oblique interpretation e.g. library => back room of library
- don't link back new people in the new entrances to existing things/problems with the first characters
