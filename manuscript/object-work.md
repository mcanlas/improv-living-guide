# Object work

## Heightening

Important to subtly heighten certain parts of object work since object is fake.

Touching it's surface features to inform the audience what shape it is.

Giving it weight by slowing down your body motions to help indicate how big it is or what it is made out of. Animation tip: slow means heavy.

## Ridiculousness

Bad plunger, bad driving of the car, bad reading a magazine.
