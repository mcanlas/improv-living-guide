# Listening

## Non-verbal contributions

At Camp Magnet 2019, in Rick Andrews workshop, he often parroted back initiations that he heard, but only focusing on the intonation and not the words. (as a means of finding deeper context)

## Character chorus

I've heard (that students are told) that characters should always have "a deal". I heard one that that this could also be like a musical chorus. That if your character has a deal or philosophy, it should probably be repeated a handful of times, just like a musical chorus.

I think this is less helpful when the scene does not call for differentiation (e.g. group scenes). Maybe every character can have a deal, but it doesn't need to be expressed explicitly (in that it might interfere with or derail the principle dynamic).

## Sound of a Harold

Nick Kanellis compares the overall vibe of a Harold to different sonic textures, like musical instruments or cartoon character sounds. Also, the occurrence of game is akin to a song structure for each texture. Beats of games happen with regularity and have periods of rest, just like traditional music.
