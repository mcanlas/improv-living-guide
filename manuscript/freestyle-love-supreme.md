# Freestyle Love Supreme

On Wednesday, January 8, 2019, I saw Freestyle Love Supreme during their last week of shows. No major guests other than the guest female beatbxoer.

## Structure of show

Our electronic devices were put in faraday bags for us to hold on to, so everything is from memory or are baseless assumptions.

### Mic check

I'm assuming not a real mic check but they layer on their entrances and identify themselves as "mic one" or "mic two" etc. The parts of the polyphony are simple and likely improvised. Ramps and ends.

### Free rap

Suggestions taken from the audience, scanned by section (e.g. left, right, center, mezz left, etc). No structure, whoever feels inspired to step up and demonstrate.

My suggestion "SQUEEZE" from the center mezzanine was taken as the first suggestion of the show. But all the performers would continually honor other suggestions as they chose/remembered.

### Suggestions from a bucket

Bucket was seeded (left and right side of the stage) before the show started.

One rapper (UTK) cyphers based on the suggestion from the bucket. Someone else pulls out suggestions from the bucket and they are always delivered on beat 1 of a new couplet.

Gets faster and faster for difficulty. Maybe close on a reference to the first suggestion.

### Things you hate 

Suggestions solicited from the audience with an MC (Two Touch). Rappers free to choose. MC rejects (or just scans more) politics, overly sexual content, etc

One suggestion per rappper. Trappy beat. Two couplets, a drop, two more couplets. Per rapper.

Cycle around again, but one couplet only, drop, then couplet.

Third cycle, one couplet each (no drop)

Ends with a comedic button from the MC.

Demonstrated on Jimmy Fallon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nERNNOtll0

Note, paper from bucket spread across floor as confetti atop each rapper (on their first drop)

### Life regrets

MC solicits stories from the audience. Gives personal story then offers "headline". This part the audience did not understand. Headlines are to help the MC scan for interesting stories.

Give us a moment in life that you regret and wished you could replay.

Chosen story was daughter's father burying the neighbor's cat.

Story is framed as a record playing (beatboxer miming).

Improvised structure-free musical is done. Some singing, some rapping, some non-rapping.

Beatboxer framer rewinds record and musical is played backwards quickly.

Second, faster, shorter musical is played out with pivotal moment replaced with something else.

There seem to be signals of when improvisors want to offer up scene changes or suggesting when to move on to the next major signpost of the story. Probably just being loud and repetitive up stage.

### Things you love

MC scans for interesting word of something people love (was "detention")

Musical director (new, fourth seat) invited up to sing. R&B, bongos, lounge vibe

Freestyle chorus is set revolving around repetitive use of the key word

Each rapper raps a true story inspired by that word

Between each rapper, chorus setter calls back chorus melodically but freestyles short jokes and commentary based on the previous rapper

Ends organically on guest chorus

Demonstrated on previous FLS comedy project on YouTube

### Day in the life

MC scans for person with interesting day. Must be specific, 5-7 people (to provide backline something to do), but not "30 people" or something generic. Over 18, sober.

Musical improv set done based on person's day

### Closing

Ends on mic check song callback

### Evergreen

Suggestions on the floor free to be picked up at any time during the show and used
