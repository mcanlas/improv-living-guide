# Openings

## Pattern game

Solicit suggestion. In an arc, organically mention things that come to mind.

## Documentary

### Magnet style

Two chairs out. Organic pairs do quick characters. No repeats.

### UCB style

Standing. Organic pairs. With callbacks to the exact same actors as the characters. Faster a la second/third beats.

When seeding scenes, anyone can initiate off any character(s) premise. Unless the character is very, very strong.

## Character monologues

Form a line. Step out one at a time (organically) and do character monologues.

### Peter style

Revisit other people's characters (e.g. second and third beats), getting faster
