# Openings

## Pattern game

Solicit suggestion. In an arc, organically mention things that come to mind.

## Documentary

### Magnet style

Two chairs out. Organic pairs do quick characters. No repeats.

### UCB style

Standing. Organic pairs. With callbacks to the exact same actors as the characters. Faster a la second/third beats.

When seeding scenes, anyone can initiate off any character(s) premise. Unless the character is very, very strong.

## Character monologues

Form a line. Step out one at a time (organically) and do character monologues.

### Peter style

Revisit other people's characters (e.g. second and third beats), getting faster

## Doc again (merge conflict)
- similar to Christopher Guest movies, mockumentary. the office, talking heads

### Magnet style

- done sitting in two chairs
- pairs are organic
- no revisits
- goal is organic (no set number; go by time/feeling)

### UCB style

- done standing
- can organically include (not mandatory) characters in the same universe (inspired by documentary form where this actually happens)
- pairs are revisited (faster a la second beats) tied to the original actors
- scenework inspired by the opening is not tied to the original actors or pairs (e.g. can be one person representing premise)
- order before second beats can be organic (e.g. ABCADE)
- goal is five character pairs

## Invocation

- "it is a hammer"
- "you are a hammer, the thing i used to x" with personal stakes
- "thou art a hammer", endowed with mythic descriptions
- "i am a hammer", channeling aspects like a spirit
