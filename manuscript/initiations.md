# Initiations

## Organic

Let the actors sit and stew in the space. Establish eye contact with your scene partner.

## Organic chairs

Place chairs in a random location on the stage. Same as above.

## Hit one

The big two are relationship and location.

"Let your where give you a who"

Relationship can do two things. Inform your character details or inform your dynamic. How do you feel, high or low status, etc.
