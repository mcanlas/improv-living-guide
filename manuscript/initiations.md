# Initiations

## Organic

Let the actors sit and stew in the space. Establish eye contact with your scene partner.

## Organic chairs

Place chairs in a random location on the stage. Same as above.

## Hit one

The big two are relationship and location.

"Let your where give you a who"

Relationship can do two things. Inform your character details or inform your dynamic. How do you feel, high or low status, etc.

## Peter style

In Magnet's conservatory, Level 5, you learn a much more patient style. You immediately follow the initiating partner out on stage, but you exist on stage as a fully formed, fully informed bored character. Contrast with the usually blank/thirsty scene partner that is waiting for their scene partner's initiation. In this style, you are ready to exist as yourself, in a fully-formed idle state, free of "wonder", free of anticipation of outside stimulus. And then you react.

Even if you have an idea from the onset, acknowledge your scene partner's current position/attitude and let it inspire you. Let it fit in your world, as opposed coming in hot with a very heady suggestion and having to figure out how to get there.
