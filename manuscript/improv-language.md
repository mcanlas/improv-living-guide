# Improv language

Often times in improv, there are devices or tropes that have a much higher occurrence in improv than in real life.

## Exposition

The vocative. Mom, Dad, Billy.

Prepositions. In this library. In this park.

Explicit descriptors: As your therapist, I feel

## Pull the trigger

We shouldn't be subtle or nice unlike in real life. We need to pull the emotional trigger to add transparency and drama. "You're being a dick right now!" should happen more on stage than in real life.

## Game patterns

"Don't do this" means "please do more of it so we can play a game using this button".

## Bad patterns

Using bombs like cancer or spaceships and reacting to them in an indifferent or jovial way.
