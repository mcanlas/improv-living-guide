# Improv language

Often times in improv, there are devices or tropes that have a much higher occurrence in improv than in real life.

## Exposition

The vocative. Mom, Dad, Billy.

Prepositions. In this library. In this park.

Explicit descriptors: As your therapist, I feel

## Pull the trigger

We shouldn't be subtle or nice unlike in real life. We need to pull the emotional trigger to add transparency and drama. "You're being a dick right now!" should happen more on stage than in real life.

## Game patterns

"Don't do this" means "please do more of it so we can play a game using this button".

## Bad patterns

Using bombs like cancer, spaceships, or divorce and reacting to them in an indifferent or jovial way.

## Subtext

Answering a question that wasn't asked.

> A: Hey, what do you think of this dress?
>
> B: She doesn't want to get back with you.

## My exercises

Practice the following phrases. Repeated emphatically until organic improv spills out.

- "In this PLACE" e.g. in this library, in our home, in this classroom
- "We are RELATIONSHIP", e.g. we are brothers, we are lovers, you are my teacher
- "I feel X", e.g. I am mad at you, I am sad about
- "Don't do X", invite other improvisor to do X more
- "Are you X", invitation to say yes to gift
- "I don't want it" means give it to me

Especially for "I feel", goal is to get comfortable using improv language that is not subtle, not coy.

"Are you X" should be played as a "yes" but can be played with light/denial (ultimately is a YES to both improvisors)

Likewise, being defensive about something ultimately means you lose. Let us see how you lose."
