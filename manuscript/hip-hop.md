# Hip-hop

The great Katy Berry once said... improvised hip-hop is the new frontier for musical improvisors. 

## Thinking

Thinking of your rap more as a structured poem rather than as a story of unlimited words. This helps combat rambling or missing the beat.

- allow the rhythm of the hook to inspire the rhythm of the verses
- think of rhyming less intellectually and more about the raw sounds made with your mouth (more flexible rhymes)

## Exercises

### Cypher

Freestyle continually. Organically take focus away from the current person.

### Topics

Topic is thrown at you. Continually freestyle until another topic is thrown at you.

Up to 3x per person. Then switch to another person. Topics can come from anywhere (student/teacher).

### Pull up

- pull up x9, high energy
- "i'm pullin up on the X"
- could be AAAA rhyme
- or AABB
- challenge mode: more syllables
- challenge mode: with character affectation

### Pass the clap into scenelete

- pass the clap
- organically claim it and start a scenelette with intro "I am X"
- everyone repeat "you are X"
- have one description line like "i like do Y"
- everyone repeat "you like do Y"
- repeat intro, everyone repeat intro, keep passing clap

### You Are

- first person "finishes" a block, gifting "you are" to the next person, doing 4 bars
- second person accepts, starting with "i am" (optional), 4 bars
- second person gifts a new person, etc
- mode 1: done in a circle
- challenge mode: non-linear pass around (so that people have to listen)

### Tell us about your week

Hook is "tell us about your week". 8 bars about your week.

### This without the that (double)

Person A's last word is Person B's first word. The rhymes are on both pairs.

1. A: A cheese without the wedge is like the bees without the hedge.
2. B. The hedge without the grass is like the ledge without the crass.

### Character wheel

- Person in the middle to be "it"
- First random person, offer a facial expression
- Second random person, offer a physical form, posture
- Third random person, offer a vocal sound
- Monologue as character
- Beatboxer comes in, do 8 bars in character

## Forms

### Musical initiations

- Beatboxer first (to free form)
- Hook first within scene
- Hook first from backline
- Verse first within scene
- toggle rap: person within scene makes clear initiation of beat drop, does one verse
  - structure is supported when second person DOES NOT rap, and beat goes away. person continues to talk and heighten
  - first person resumes by signaling and dropping another verse, etc

### Song forms

- Hook, verse, hook, verse, hook (for two person scenes)

Hook is 4 lines (or 8 if half lines)

Verse is 8 bars

Can split verses in group scenes

### Group game

- initiate as homogeneous drop (we're all dentists) with hook
- sandwich verses with hook
- each verse heightens
- third vs can be normal heighten or absurd heighten
  - if absurd heighten, team steps in to cut beat and talk them off the ledge
  - then signal to drop last hook with beat
