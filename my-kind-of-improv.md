# My Kind of Improv

A Magnet teacher once lamented, someone saying "I'm not into improv" is like saying "I'm not into television". It's weird to write off an entire medium. But I guess the problem stems from lack of exposure to different kinds of improv. Here are some aspects that really resonate with me.

## Organic delivery

Compare the following lines.

> You're a doctor. I need help.
>
> Doc, gimme the news.

The first is something a novice improvisor might say. It's effective in establishing a reality and a relationship. But it just sounds stilted. It's improv-speak.

The second is much more natural-sounding. But the trap here is that it requirements much more interpretation on the listener's end. If you don't have a sharp partner who is picking up what you're laying down, lines like this might get you in trouble. As an audience member, I always much prefer the most organic delivery possible.

## Fast listening

Here's an initiation.

> Shannon!? Shannon Bernacky? It's Alice, from John Jay High!

Here are two responses.

> Hi. We went to high school together.
>
> Class of 2004! AHHH!!!!

The first response is a very straight "yes and" but it's more of just a "yes". The two players have firmly established their relationship to the audience and one another. However, it's boring and lacks a lot of "and".

The second response adds more information and confirms the relationship via emotion rather than via words. I prefer watching moves like this, but they can be more difficult to play if the people on stage aren't in sync. A way to tank a sexy response like this is for the first player to say the following because they were not sure if their partner understood.

> Shannon, we went to high school together.

Now we've established to everyone that we are not on the same page and need to invest in safety lines like this.

## Degree of difficulty

## Musical improv

In general, a musical improv team commits harder and faster than a normal team. Straight improv rarely hits high highs where as musical improv is very effective very often.

The "highlights" thread for musical improv is always much more boistrous and elaborate than the highlights thread for other nights.
